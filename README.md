# SimpleRepertoire

Assumed goal of `SimpleRepertoire` is to gather piano sheets from songs available in SimplePiano app.  

Using SimplePiano as a learning tool works a wonder but it's actually quite frustrating when you reached ★★★ level on a song to have to use SimplePiano interface to practise it.

With SimpleRepertoire you'll have access to the exact same sheet available in a classical format (.xml, .pdf, .png).

## How it works

### Edit a .musicxl score

I recommend to submit files edited using *Musescore 3.6* as it is the software that I use.  
Using other editing software may result into unexpected behaviour if we both edit the file.

Using the *Musescore* can be daunting to use at first, don't hesitate to peruse available tutorials at
https://musescore.org/en/tutorials.
