# Simple-Repertoire

Using [Simply Piano](https://www.joytunes.com/simply-piano) as a learning tool works a wonder but it's actually quite frustrating when you reached ★★★ level on a song to have to use SimplePiano interface to practise it.

With SimpleRepertoire you'll have access to the exact same sheet available in a classical format (.xml, .pdf, .png).

## Features

- high-fidelity : scores are faithfully replicated from the app
- single page full-width png output for portable devices  
- pdf output for prints or ebooks

### Editing a score sheet

I use [MuseScore 3.6](https://musescore.org/en/3.6) to edit score sheets, it's cross-platform and has great UX.  
For the sake of simplicity, only uncompressed MuseScore 3 files (.mscx) will be accepted for contributions.

### Uploading a score sheet 

Ready to contribute and share your favourite score ? Great ! 

1. Start by opening a Pull Request titled _`WIP: <Artist> - <Song>`_ to _lock_ the song
1. The PR should consists of one single uncompressed MuseScore 3 file (.mscx) obeying the following naming convention : 
   `Repertoire/<category>/<Artist>-<Song>/<Artist>-<Song>.mscx`
1. Add commits over time and remove the _`WIP: `_ prefix from the PR title when it's ready to signal completeness
